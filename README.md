This is the most interesting code in this project for me 
because I feel very challenge on it and learn a lot from 
it when I work on it too. It help me to brainstorm 
many way or function to process the data. In the end,
it is funny that I realized sometimes I just need to 
switch my thinking's logic and it will not hard like I thought.
